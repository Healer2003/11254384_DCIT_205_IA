## Project Reflection:
During the development of this website, I gained insights into effective web design, database management, and collaborative project development. Overcoming challenges such as styling, working with divs and flexboxes strengthened my problem-solving skills. Looking ahead, I plan to enhance the website by introducing new features to make it more interactive.

*Thank you for viewing my project on the University of Ghana Computer Science Department website. I hope this project enriches your experience.For feedback or issues, please feel free to reach out.*
